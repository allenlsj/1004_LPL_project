# Spark-lean
Spark-lean, an interactive PySpark-based Data Cleaning Library

## Features
* Data versioning
* Missing value detection
* Text cleaning
* Featurization
* String Matching
* Anomaly detectation

## Installation

`pip install Spark-lean`

## Idea
Spark-lean is a toolkit we built for cleaning and pre-processing large-scale datasets. From our own experience with different data cleaning libraries, we designed a very unique structure that makes the process more interactive and user-friendly. We minimize the operations that users need to perform and provide essential information to users at the same time.  

## Assumptions
When we were designing this library, we made a few assumptions about the use-cases:
* Large-scale Data
* Data-frame structure
* Single dataset


## How to use
### Dependencies
Please make sure that you have Pyspark installed and have run it successfully.

## Initialization

* start SparkContext
* read data

## Functions
